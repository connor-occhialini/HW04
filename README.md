# Physics 2200 HW04

Computes the radius of the circle inscribed by a triangle.  First, the structure 'point' is defined, which corresponds to a coordinate pair, and then the structure 'triangle' is defined using 3 point structures corresponding to each vertex of a triangle.  Functions 'distance' and 'radius' are then defined, which calculate the distance between vertices and the radius of the inscribed circle, respectively.
